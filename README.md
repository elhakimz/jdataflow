A Flow Based Programming dataflow implementation for Java, using Meemoo and FBP
This my implementation of FBP (http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/) web based development tool in Java using Meemoo Dataflow ( https://github.com/meemoo/dataflow) , I choose Meemoo Dataflow beside NoFlo-Ui because the graph editor meets my requirements for simplicity and extendability.
