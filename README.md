A Web based Flow Based Programming dataflow development  for Java, using Meemoo Dataflow and FBP
This my implementation of FBP (http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/) web based development tool in Java using Meemoo Dataflow ( https://github.com/meemoo/dataflow), I choose Meemoo Dataflow  (not NoFlo-UI) because the graph editor meets my requirements for simplicity and extendability.

This tool actually for my daily works in java programming. I hope this will give a contribution in future programming techniques. :)
