A Flow Based Programming dataflow implementation for Java, using Meemoo and FBP
This my implementation of FBP (http://www.jpaulmorrison.com/fbp/) web based development tool in Java using Meemoo Dataflow ( https://github.com/meemoo/dataflow) , I choose Meemoo Dataflow beside NoFlo-Ui because the graph editor meets my requirements for simplicity and extendability.

Requirements
------------
- Servlet container (Tomcat or Jetty)
- Recent HTML browser
- Libraries: FBP Library, Meemoo Dataflow codes, JAX-RS, Bootstrap 3.0 and extensions, ACE Editor (JS), JQuery UI and extensions.
